    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Served warm, gajar ka halwa (carrot halwa) is a sweet pudding of simmered carrots, milk, sugar, and cardamom</p>
    <p>There are several types of halwa in South Asia and this carrot halwa is especially popular during both Diwali and Eid.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 cups shredded carrots</li>
        <li>8 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>24 green cardamom pods or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup slivered almonds, toasted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry- roasted pistachio nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine carrots, milk, and sugar in a 6- to 8-qt. Dutch oven; bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid has evaporated, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle or a rolling pin to break open cardamom pods. Coarsely crush seeds, discarding the shells. (If using ground cardamom, skip this step.)</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook half of cardamom until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add carrot mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and jammy, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in remaining cardamom. Sprinkle with almonds and pistachios just before serving. (Chill in an airtight container up to 5 days; freeze up to 3 months.)</li>
    </ol>
